# Atlas Labs HR-Attrition Analysis Project

## Objectives
In this project, we explore a dataset from a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. We import, analyze, and visualize the data using Microsoft Excel, with the goal of developing a clean, self-explanatory, and interactive dashboard for the HR team. Through thorough exploratory data analysis and visualizations, we dive deeper into attrition and the factors that influence it. This analysis will help the organization determine actionable steps to retain more employees.

## Target Audience
- HR Team

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel for analyzing and creating the Atlas Labs HR Attrition Dashboard.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was provided by the DataCamp platform. It consists of three tables: `employee.csv`, `performance_rating.csv`, and `education_level.csv`. These tables were imported into Microsoft Excel using Power Query for data transformation and cleansing. Subsequently, a data model was built in Power Pivot to facilitate exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the creation of an interactive dashboard.

## Key Questions Explored:
1. What is the total number of employees?
2. What is the number of current employees?
3. What is the average age of employees who left?
4. What is the average salary of current employees?
5. What is the attrition rate in each department?
6. What is the effect of salary on attrition?
7. How does attrition vary across different age groups, gender, marital status, and other demographics?
8. How does attrition vary with distance from home?
9. Is there a difference in attrition based on education level and job role?
10. How does travel frequency affect attrition?
11. How does employee tenure affect attrition?
12. Does lack of promotion contribute to attrition?
13. Does overtime impact attrition?
14. What is the attrition rate in each department?

## Executive Summary:

### Main Insights
- Atlas Labs has employed 1,470 individuals since its inception, with 1,233 current employees and a total attrition of 237, resulting in an overall attrition rate of **16.12%**.
- The **Sales Department** exhibits the highest attrition rate at **20.63%**, followed by **Human Resources** (19.05%) and **Technology** (13.84%).
- A deeper analysis of job roles shows that **lower salaries** are correlated with **higher attrition rates**. Sales Representatives have the highest attrition rate (39.76%) among all roles, followed by Recruiters (37.50%) and Data Scientists (23.75%). Dissatisfaction related to lower average salaries is a key driver of attrition.
- A significant portion of employees who left were between the ages of **20 and 29**, many of whom had **no formal degree** or only a **bachelor’s degree**.
- Most employees who left did so within **their first year** of employment, often after only a few months.
- Employees who worked **overtime** experienced an attrition rate of **30.53%** and did not receive promotions, likely due to their short tenure.
- A significant percentage of departing employees were required to **travel frequently**, with an attrition rate of **24.91%**.
- **Single males** had the highest attrition rate at **26.41%**, followed by **single females** at **22.71%**, potentially due to frequent job-related travel and short employment durations.
- Most of the employees with the highest attrition rates live in **California**.

### Key Recommendations
- The **Sales Department** has the highest attrition rate, indicating the need for deeper investigation into the causes of dissatisfaction. Offering **more competitive salaries**, **performance bonuses**, or **additional benefits** could help retain employees in these roles.
- Given that a large proportion of departing employees are aged **20–29** and tend to leave after short periods, implementing strong **professional development** and **training programs** could help retain this group.
- Promote **Career Growth Opportunities** by implementing clear **career advancement paths** and offering frequent **performance reviews** with defined milestones for promotion, especially for younger employees.
- **Mentorship programs**, especially for younger or less experienced employees, could improve job satisfaction and career growth, reducing early attrition. A more thorough **onboarding process** could also lower turnover rates during the first year.
- Build a company culture that emphasizes **employee well-being**, **recognition**, and **inclusivity**. Regular engagement activities, recognizing top performers, and support networks for different demographics (e.g., young professionals, single employees) may reduce attrition.
- Frequent **job-related travel** is associated with higher attrition. Revisiting **travel policies** to align with employee expectations could help reduce turnover.
- To address **work pressure** and **overtime**, providing additional compensation or flexible work arrangements may alleviate dissatisfaction and encourage longer employee tenure.

## Lessons Learned:
- Utilized **Power Pivot** for data modeling and the creation of measures using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**.
- Employed **Power Query** for data cleansing and feature engineering to enhance data quality.
- Developed **pivot tables** leveraging data models for insightful analysis.
- Designed an interactive **HR attrition dashboard** for effective data visualization and analysis.
